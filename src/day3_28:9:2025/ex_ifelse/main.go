//--Summary:
//  The existing program is used to restrict access to a resource
//  based on day of the week and user role. Currently, the program
//  allows any user to access the resource. Implement the functionality
//  needed to grant resource access using any combination of `if`, `else if`,
//  and `else`.
//
//--Requirements:
//? Use the accessGranted() and accessDenied() functions to display informational messages
//? Access at any time: Admin, Manager
//? Access weekends: Contractor
//? Access weekdays: Member
//? Access Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays: Guest

	//?Question: Employee Salary & Bonus Evaluator

	//? Write a Go program that evaluates an employeeâ€™s net salary based on their performance and years of experience.

	//? Requirements:

	//? Create a function bonus(baseSalary float64, years int) float64 that returns a bonus amount based on experience:

	//? If years â‰¥ 10 â†’ 20% of base salary

	//? If years â‰¥ 5 â†’ 10% of base salary

	//? Otherwise â†’ 5% of base salary

	//? In main(), let the user input:

	//? Employee name

	//? Base salary

	//? Years of experience

	//? Performance rating (Excellent, Good, Average, Poor)

	//? Calculate net salary as:

	//? net = baseSalary + bonus(baseSalary, years)

	//? Apply performance adjustment with if / else if:

	//? Excellent â†’ +10% extra on net

	//? Good â†’ +5% extra on net

	//? Average â†’ no change

	//? Poor â†’ -5% penalty

	//? Print:

	//? Employee name

	//? Base Salary

	//? Bonus

	//? Net Salary after performance adjustment

	//? Final Status:

	//? "Outstanding" if net â‰¥ 1,000,000

	//? "Well Settled" if net â‰¥ 500,000

	//? "Needs Growth" otherwise

	//? ðŸ”¹ Example Run
	//? Enter Employee Name: Alice
	//? Enter Base Salary: 800000
	//? Enter Years of Experience: 12
	//? Enter Performance (Excellent/Good/Average/Poor): Excellent

	// ? Employee: Alice
	// ? Base Salary: 800000
	// ? Bonus: 160000
	// ? Net Salary after Performance: 1056000
	// ? Final Status: Outstanding
}
