//? ðŸ§© Question: Number Guessing Game

//? Write a Go program that lets the user guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 100.

/* Requirements:
*The program should:
~Generate a random number between 0 and 100 using the math/rand package.

~Ask the user to enter their name and then start the game with a friendly greeting.

~Prompt the user to guess the number.

*After each guess:

~If the guess is too high, display: "Too high! Try again."

~If the guess is too low, display: "Too low! Try again."

~If the guess is correct, display: "Congratulations <name>! You guessed it right in X attempts!"

~Use a function named checkGuess(secret, guess int) string that:

~Returns "high", "low", or "correct" depending on the comparison.

~Count and display how many guesses the player made before getting the right number.

*When the user wins, ask:
~"Do you want to play again? (yes/no)"

~If yes â†’ restart the game.

~If no â†’ exit the program with a goodbye message.

*/

/*
	Extra Challenge (optional):

~ Limit the player to 10 attempts.
~ If they fail, display: "Game over! The correct number was X."

~ Add difficulty levels (Easy: 0â€“50, Hard: 0â€“100, Expert: 0â€“500).
